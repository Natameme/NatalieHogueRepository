This project is currently unfinished

What works: JS code can aquire your locaton, the javascript code can test your distance from all vehicles on a particular MBTA line (data taken from the MBTA API)
given this information, the page turns red when a train is approaching the given location, a list of vehicles can also be seen in the javascript console

What doesn't work yet: Leaflet.js maps don't work, trackers for vehicles would be a welcome addition, as well as a draggable pin for user location, and options 
for setting a radius inside which the user is notified about an approaching train

in short: the backend is *mostly* there even if the front-end looks and feels like dogshit to use
