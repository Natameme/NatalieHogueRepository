#HarmToDec test

HarmToDec is a proof of concept experiment with Spectralism and microtonal music. 

HarmToDec.c is a very simple program that takes an integer value as an input (representing a partial of the harmonic series) if the value is >2 (higher pitch than the octave) it enters a loop in which the value is divided until it is less than an octave, at which point it prints to the console. 

The purpose behind this is to generate a pitch scalar allowing the user to generate intervals within the octave space, that are based off of the harmonic series. I would like to spin this into something that produces sound, ideally as I develop my float frequency/velocity instrument control protocol. Collaborator on this project are more than welcome to uses this code for whatever they want with attribution!
