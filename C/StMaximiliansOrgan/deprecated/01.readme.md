##DEPRECATED CODE README

  this folder is a graveyard for prototypes and deprecated models. Some work, others do not, it has been left in as a means of showing the development process, and the effort that it took even to get it to where it is currently.

## steps to run any given model:

###Step 1

Set your console directory to Final/deprecated/

###Step 2a

Make sure your midi controller is plugged in before opening the program

###Step 2b

The line to compile each program is at the top of each C file, following the rough structure

    `clang Filename.c -o Filename -lportaudio -lportmidi && ./Filename`

The code will run through and midi setting, ideally it should return without an error, however in the event that you get an "invalid device ID" error,

    - Look through the list of audio and midi device and take the respective ID numbers for your desired devices

    - go into OrganSecondBuild.c and in the Constants Section (line 14) reinstantiate "kAudioDeviceOutputIndex" and "kMIDIInputDeviceID" with the correct numbers corresponding to the device you wish to user

###Step 3

    - Once you compile and run the code with no error you should be good to start making sound! hit a note on your keyboard and try it out.

    - Polyphony and the ability to pull in and out stops are coming in a later version. For now the (admittedly janky) method of pulling in and out stops is to comment out the stops you don't want at line 364.
